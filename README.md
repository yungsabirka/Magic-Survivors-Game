# Description

My game is inspired by the Vampire Survivors project with some changes. 
###
## In the game you can see:

- A variety of monsters with different behavior and attack systems.
- A system of pumping directly during the game, as well as through the store in the menu.
- Interesting additions to the attack mechanics
- Pleasant interface

(A gameplay video can be seen at the bottom of the Readme file)
